  Community Literature Data

## Introduction

The goal of `seed.text` is to collect structured literature data for general
consumption. All of this data will be hosted on [`chat.surf`](https://chat.surf), a website devoted to literature and languages across the globe, throughout history. If you see something there that needs to be fixed, this is the repo to probably make the change.

For more related open community data projects, see [`seed`](https://github.com/wavebond/seed).

## Data Sources

We collect data from a variety of places both from the web and from physical books and such. Here is a brief overview of some of the data sources we have currently used.

- **[ctext.org](https://ctext.org/)**: This is where many of the Chinese texts come from.
- **[biblehub.com](https://biblehub.com/)**: Where we get snippets and links to the Christian bible translations.
- **[SATDB](https://21dzk.l.u-tokyo.ac.jp/SAT/satdb2015.php)**: Where some of the Chinese Buddhist texts come from.
- **[tipitaka.org](https://tipitaka.org/)**: Where the original XML data for the Tripitaka comes from.

## Contribute

If you have some structured language data to work with, please
[open an issue or PR](https://github.com/wavebond/seed.text/issues) with a
link to the content (whether as spreadsheets, json, etc.) so we can add
it to the collection.

## License

As much as possible of this project is released under the **public
domain** (whatever does not already have other licenses). This is
because _this_ "data" (even structured data), legally, can't be "owned",
as it is public knowledge. So we simply make it availble for free.

Otherwise, if there are specific datasets which have existing licenses,
like the Chinese
[cedict](https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary?page=cedict) dataset,
which uses the "Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0
International License", then those datasets are governed by that
license. We will do our best to keep the license data in tact for
projects as we go, but if we make any mistakes or could improve things
in this arena, please reach out and let us know how we can get things
better.
